decision trees, tested and visualized. Used GraphViz(open-source graph visualization software). The time has come to analyze the car temperature data from me. Cleaned it and modeled it with 3 different tree-based models. sklearn's DecisionTreeClassifier, DecisionTreeRegressor, and RandomForestRegressor classes.
